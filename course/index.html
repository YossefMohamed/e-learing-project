            Computer programming is the process of designing and building an
            executable computer program for accomplishing a specific computing
            task, often for solving a given problem. The process of programming
            thus often requires expertise in several different subjects,
            including knowledge of the application domain, specialized
            algorithms, and formal logic.<br /><br />
            Tasks accompanying and related to programming include: testing,
            debugging, source code maintenance, implementation of build systems,
            and management of derived artifacts, such as the machine code of
            computer programs.

          <p class="p1">
            Art is a diverse range of human activities in creating visual,
            auditory or performing artifacts (artworks), expressing the author's
            imaginative, conceptual ideas, or technical skill, intended to be
            appreciated for their beauty or emotional power. In their most
            general form these activities include the production of works of
            art, the criticism of art, the study of the history of art, and the
            aesthetic dissemination of art. <br /><br />
            The three classical branches of art are painting, sculpture and
            architecture. Music, theatre, film, dance, and other performing
            arts, as well as literature and other media such as interactive
            media, are included in a broader definition of the arts. Until the
            17th century, art referred to any skill or mastery and was not
            differentiated from crafts or sciences. In modern usage after the
            17th century, where aesthetic considerations are paramount, the fine
            arts are separated and distinguished from acquired skills in
            general, such as the decorative or applied arts.

            Business is the activity of making one's living or making money by
            producing or buying and selling products (such as goods and
            services).need quotation to verify Simply put, it is "any activity
            or enterprise entered into for profit. It does not mean it is a
            company, a corporation, partnership, or have any such formal
            organization, but it can range from a street peddler to General
            Motors." <br /><br />
            Having a business name does not separate the business entity from
            the owner, which means that the owner of the business is responsible
            and liable for debts incurred by the business. If the business
            acquires debts, the creditors can go after the owner's personal
            possessions. A business structure does not allow for corporate tax
            rates. The proprietor is personally taxed on all income from the
            business.

          <p class="p1">
            Photography is the art, application and practice of creating durable
            images by recording light or other electromagnetic radiation, either
            electronically by means of an image sensor, or chemically by means
            of a light-sensitive material such as photographic film. It is
            employed in many fields of science, manufacturing (e.g.,
            photolithography), and business, as well as its more direct uses for
            art, film and video production, recreational purposes, hobby, and
            mass communication. <br /><br />
            Typically, a lens is used to focus the light reflected or emitted
            from objects into a real image on the light-sensitive surface inside
            a camera during a timed exposure. With an electronic image sensor,
            this produces an electrical charge at each pixel, which is
            electronically processed and stored in a digital image file for
            subsequent display or processing.

          <p class="p1">
            Design can have different connotations in different fields of
            application (see design disciplines below), but there are two basic
            meanings of design: as a verb and as a noun. <br /><br />
            The process of creating a design can be brief (a quick sketch) or
            lengthy and complicated, involving considerable research,
            negotiation, reflection, modelling, interactive adjustment and
            re-design. In some cases, the direct construction of an object
            without an explicit prior plan (such as in craftwork and some
            engineering, coding, and graphic design) is also considered to be a
            design activity.

          <div class="image-div language"></div>

          <p class="p1">
            The scientific study of language is called linguistics. Questions
            concerning the philosophy of language, such as whether words can
            represent experience, have been debated at least since Gorgias and
            Plato in ancient Greece. Thinkers such as Rousseau have argued that
            language originated from emotions while others like Kant have held
            that it originated from rational and logical thought. 20th-century
            philosophers such as Wittgenstein argued that philosophy is really
            the study of language. Major figures in linguistics include
            Ferdinand de Saussure and Noam Chomsky. <br /><br />
            Estimates of the number of human languages in the world vary between
            5,000 and 7,000. However, any precise estimate depends on a partly
            arbitrary distinction between languages and dialects. Natural
            languages are spoken or signed, but any language can be encoded into
            secondary media using auditory, visual, or tactile stimuli – for
            example, in whistling, signed, or braille. This is because human
            language is modality-independent. Depending on philosophical
            perspectives regarding the definition of language and meaning, when
            used as a general concept, "language" may refer to the cognitive
            ability to learn and use systems of complex communication, or to
            describe the set of rules that makes up these systems, or the set of
            utterances that can be produced from those rules.

            Adobe Photoshop is a raster graphics editor developed and published
            by Adobe Inc. for macOS and Windows. It was originally created in
            1988 by Thomas and John Knoll. Since then, this software has become
            the industry standard not only in raster graphics editing, but in
            digital art as a whole. The software's name has thus become a
            generic trademark, leading to its usage as a verb (e.g. "to
            photoshop an image", "photoshopping", and "photoshop contest")
            although Adobe discourages such use. <br /><br />
            Photoshop's naming scheme was initially based on version numbers.
            However, in October 2002 (following the introduction of Creative
            Suite branding), each new version of Photoshop was designated with
            "CS" plus a number; e.g., the eighth major version of Photoshop was
            Photoshop CS and the ninth was Photoshop CS2. Photoshop CS3 through
            CS6 were also distributed in two different editions: Standard and
            Extended.
